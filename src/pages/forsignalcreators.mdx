# Signal Creators

Other signal-copying services place market orders in your follower's accounts ... because it's HARD to intelligently handle all the edge cases and what-ifs (such as rejected orders and partial fills) that popup when following a signal using limit orders. As you probably already know, all of their systems experience degraded performance due to the slippage of market orders. Originally-profitable systems can become disappointing losers in your follower's accounts when you use other signal-copying services.

`Trade Signal Server` has done the hard work of figuring out how to intelligently handle the intrinsics of following your signals with limit orders, keeping your followers just as profitable as you.
