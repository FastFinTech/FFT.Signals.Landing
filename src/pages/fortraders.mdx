# For Traders

## Copy your trades into multiple accounts

This is particularly useful if you trade multiple accounts simultaneously. Add multiple funded accounts.

Trade Signal Server was built by a veteran trader to solve 20 years of frustration with inadequate signal services and to create a way to get away from staring at the computer screen all day. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Protocol API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).
</Note>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Protocol offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install the Protocol JavaScript SDK
npm install @example/protocol-api --save
```

```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
# Install the Protocol Python SDK
pip install protocol_api
```

```bash {{ language: 'php' }}
# Install the Protocol PHP SDK
composer require protocol/sdk
```

```csharp {{ language: 'csharp' }}
// This should be good c#
public class Hello {
  public string H1 { get; } => "good one";
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/sdks"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Check out our list of first-party SDKs"
  />
</div>

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Protocol API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
```

```js
import ApiClient from '@example/protocol-api'

const client = new ApiClient(token)

await client.conversations.list()
```

```python
from protocol_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.conversations.list()
```

```php
$client = new \Protocol\ApiClient($token);

$client->conversations->list();
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/conversations"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint"
  />
</div>
