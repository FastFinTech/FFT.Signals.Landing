  'Explains how Trade Signal Server can help you if you are a trader.'

# For Traders

Trading profitably is hard. Even if youâ€™ve made it far enough to consistently profit, it takes massive daily chunks of time and effort out of your life to ensure you are always there when the market moves, entering your orders correctly into the system, and reviewing your performance.

Let our automated systems do the hard work for you. The `Trade Signal Server` streams profitable signals right into your trading platform or your phone, allowing you to simply accept or reject each signal as it is completely managed for you in your account. You can focus your time doing what matters to you whilst reviewing notifications and having full control of the professional order management occurring in your account.

Do you trust the professional traders creating the signals? Then, with a single click on your phone, allow all the signals to be executed, relax and enjoy the results. 

Do you feel bullish on EURUSD? Then use your phone to remotely tune your filter to accept only buy signals on EURUSD. When you feel the trend is over, turn it off or switch on sells as well. 

Are you unsure which instruments are moving right now? Check out the `heatmap` to see where the market action is taking place. You might be trading currencies one moment, and switch over to crypto when the `heatmap` tells you trends are starting there.

`Trade Signal Server` works with all instrument types including the most modern recent instruments such as crypto.

With the signals and their execution taken care of by the automated system, you become the chief strategist of your trading operation. Take a step back from order entry. You watch the market and decide which instruments, signal types, and trading directions you should employ at the present time. Like a boss, you set your strategy and allow the `Trade Signal Server` to execute it for you, all on autopilot.

Every signal arrives on your phone or trading platform with a complete description and supporting charts. You can accept or reject the signal individually. You can modify any characteristic of any signal at any time, or immediately close it out at any time.

Would you like to share your trades, or have them duplicated in multiple accounts of your own? `Trade Signal Server` can read the orders you place in your trading platform, creating signals to send to your duplicate accounts and any followers you may have, if you choose to enable that. If you write code, you can use our api to send automated signals as well.

Are you worried about slippage caused by using market orders in your account? `Trade Signal Server` only uses the same Limit and Stop Limit orders as the original signal creator, and it skillfully handles all the edge-cases that may happen in your account like missed fills, partial fills, and order rejection, keeping you informed and ready to respond at all times.
